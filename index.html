<p>I am a quantitative psychology PhD student at the University of Notre Dame. I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics and psychology at the College of William and Mary. My research interest lies in the intersection of item response theory and response time modeling where I try to explore old concepts in IRT and reinvent them under the response time context. I am also interested in meta analysis and I am currently working on a project to meta-analyze papers pertains to COVID engagement in classrooms. </p>
