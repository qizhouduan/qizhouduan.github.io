<h1>Qizhou Duan</h1>
<p> I am a failure. My advisor wants to kick me out. My labmates think I am lazy. I try, but it becomes increasingly difficult to continue. I am disillusioned about academia, where people are not treated as people but their work. It's the number of publication that matters, not you. No No, you are no one until you publish. I think that's wrong, and I have decided that I will try to play their game, and then proven them wrong. </p>
