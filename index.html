<h1>Qizhou Duan</h1>
<p> I am a failure. My advisor wants to kick me out. My labmates think I am lazy. I try, but it becomes increasingly difficult to continue. I am disillusioned about academia, where people are not treated as people but their work. It's the number of publication that matters, not you. No No, you are no one until you publish, and even when you publish, the hierarchical structure of academia weigh you down. It's killing the sparks of humanity, the ingenuity of spirits, the very ground that generates vitality for a person. I think that's wrong, and I have decided that I will try to play their game, at the same time retain my spirit and then prove them wrong. </p>
